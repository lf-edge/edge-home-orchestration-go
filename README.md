## Introduction
The main purpose of **Edge Orchestration project** is to implement distributed computing between Docker Container enabled devices. 

<img src="docs/images/lf-edge-intro_400.png" alt="image" align="left"/>

All the devices (TVs, fridges, washing machines, etc.) connected into *Home Edge Network* are considered *Home Edge Devices*. Some of the devices, possessing significant H/W resources and capable of running containerized applications, are called *Home Edge Nodes*. Tasks performed on devices of *Home Edge Network* are managed by *Home Edge Orchestrator* software. These tasks are called *Home Edge Applications*. They are assigned to specific *Home Edge Nodes*. As of now, *Home Edge Orchestrator* incessantly scans the *Home Edge Network*, forming lists of attached devices, and forms ratings of performance for them. Performance ratings are basis for deciding on which devices *Home Edge Applications* are to be run. If *Home Edge Orchestrator* cannot find device with rating higher than its own device rating, it will start the *Home Edge Application* locally. *Home Edge Networks* support distributed applications consisting of interacting Docker container instances. Docker containers offer quick deployment, easy management, safety and hardware independence. Applications that can run on *Home Edge Network* are deployed from cloud-based centralized storage as needed. Assortment of applications is determined by tasks that must be solved by *Home Edge Network*.

## Quick start of the Edge Orchestration (w/ and w/o build)

#### Prerequisites
  - At least one device (see [Platforms supported](#platforms-supported)) that can be a *Home Edge Device* (preferably more than one) 
  - Same network connected among the *Home Edge Devices*.
  - Same Authentication key in /var/edge-orchestration/user/orchestration_userID.txt
  - Edge Orchestration Docker image
> The quick start guide contains instructions on where to find Edge Orchestration Docker image and how to create Authentication key 

### The Edge Orchestration workflow is as follows:

0. Run the Edge Orchestration container at *Home Edge Nodes*.
1. *Home Edge Device* generates and sends a Service Execution request via the REST API to a host machine (currently itself).
2. Then the host machine becomes an *Home Edge Orchestrator*. 
3. Other *Home Edge Nodes* receive the Service Execution request from *Home Edge Orchestrator* via REST API.
4. The *Home Edge Node* gets and compares the **scores** from the other *Home Edge Nodes*.
5. The Service Execution on the *Home Edge Node* that has the highest score.
> *Home Edge Orchestrator* also gets and compares **scores** and if it has the highest score, the service is executed on *Home Edge Orchestrator*.
