summary: Demonstrate the Device SDK go in EdgeX using device-simple
title: EdgeX Simple Device Service
description: |
  device-simple is an example EdgeX Device Service built using the 
  device-sdk-go.

# What architectures to build the snap on
architectures:
  - build-on: amd64
  - build-on: arm64

# The "stability" of the snap and what users can expect from it
# Note that "devel" grade cannot be released to stable or candidate channels
grade: stable
confinement: strict

# edinburgh release is epoch 1
epoch: 2

apps:
  device-simple:
    # `adapter` specifies what kind of environment variables need to be setup
    # for the app, since our app is a statically compiled go app, we don't 
    # need any of the env vars, but if this was a c program or used cgo, we 
    # would need adapter: full
    adapter: none
    command: bin/device-simple -confdir $SNAP_DATA/config/device-simple -profile res --registry $CONSUL_ADDR
    # Since we can't include the colon ':' characters in the command above,
    # we need to specify the consul address in an env var like so
    # see https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1827392 for more details
    environment:
      CONSUL_ADDR: "consul://localhost:8500"
    # The service is a simple service that is directly exec'd and expected to
    # always run in a single long-lived process
    daemon: simple
    # Use network and network-bind plugs to access the network and bind to 
    # ports on network interfaces
    plugs: [network, network-bind]

parts:
  # This go part is necessary because it's expected that this snapcraft.yaml
  # will be build on Linux Foundation infrastructure and as such runs in a 
  # docker container. Since this may be run in a docker container, we can't 
  # use the default (and convenient) `build-snaps: [go/1.15]` inside the
  # device-simple part which requires a working snapd which isn't available
  # inside a docker container
